# PROMPT-07 Closure Audit

```yaml
prompt_id: PROMPT-07
audit_date: 2026-07-06
branch: project-gate-prompt-07-closure-audit
pull_request: 26
mode: closure_audit_and_stale_prose_cleanup

```

## Scope

This closure audit reviews `PROMPT-00` through `PROMPT-06` handoffs, canonical docs, behavioral coverage, implementation status, CI workflow wiring, and known evidence gaps.

It does not add transition features, specialist schemas, specialist logic, or new acceptance paths.

## Handoff files reviewed

| handoff | exists | key conclusion |
|---|---:|---|
| `docs/handoffs/PROMPT-00_HANDOFF.md` | yes | audit/freeze baseline recorded; tests were not run in that prompt |
| `docs/handoffs/PROMPT-01_HANDOFF.md` | yes | deterministic core, lock/result schema hardening, and Inspector follow-up history recorded |
| `docs/handoffs/PROMPT-02_HANDOFF.md` | yes | behavioral coverage validator/fixtures/CI history recorded |
| `docs/handoffs/PROMPT-03_HANDOFF.md` | yes | runner boundary and official tool execution history recorded |
| `docs/handoffs/PROMPT-04_HANDOFF.md` | yes | historical CE→Builder handoff now marks PR #20 merged and owner-fixture integration verified |
| `docs/handoffs/PROMPT-05_HANDOFF.md` | yes | Builder→Responsive and Final Gate exact-head CI evidence recorded |
| `docs/handoffs/PROMPT-06_HANDOFF.md` | yes | Persian report UX, typography, theme, atomic writing, and exact-head CI evidence recorded |

No prompt output should rely on model memory only; the continuation state is captured in handoff files plus canonical docs.

## Canonical docs synchronized

Updated in this closure audit:

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/ROLE_BOUNDARY_MAP.md`
- `docs/TRANSITION_BOUNDARY_MAP.md`
- `docs/RESULT_MODEL.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.yaml`
- `docs/BEHAVIORAL_RULE_COVERAGE.md`
- `docs/CLOSURE_AUDIT.md`
- `docs/handoffs/PROMPT-07_HANDOFF.md`

Reviewed without change:

- `docs/STATUS_DECISION_MATRIX.md`
- `docs/DIAGNOSTIC_CODES.md`
- `docs/LOCK_MANIFEST_POLICY.md`
- `docs/STANDARDS_TRACEABILITY.md`
- `docs/REPORT_UX_CONTRACT.md`

## Stale prose fixed

| stale/conflicting prose | correction |
|---|---|
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` still said Builder→Responsive and Final Gate were not implemented | synchronized to `orchestration_baseline: implemented` with real evidence still `insufficient_evidence` |
| `docs/ROLE_BOUNDARY_MAP.md` implementation summary still listed Builder→Responsive and Final Gate as not implemented | synchronized implementation summary and Project Gate-owned authority row |
| `docs/TRANSITION_BOUNDARY_MAP.md` still described Prompt-05 exact-head CI as pending | synchronized to Prompt-05 and Prompt-06 exact-head CI evidence |
| `docs/RESULT_MODEL.md` still had a Prompt-03-only status line and omitted later transition result schemas/report records | updated to include CE→Builder, Builder→Responsive, Final Gate, and report rendering boundaries |
| `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.yaml` lacked Prompt-06 merged/evidence summary | added Prompt-06 PR/workflow evidence and Prompt-07 closure audit status |
| `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.yaml` still marked Prompt-07 PR checks as pending after CI passed on head `531960f76f1ca0f09b948b69578dbb968e464ff6` | updated Prompt-07 status to exact-head CI success with workflow run IDs |
| `docs/CLOSURE_AUDIT.md` and `docs/handoffs/PROMPT-07_HANDOFF.md` still contained handoff-time pending-check statements | refreshed current Prompt-07 PR check evidence while keeping local-test limitations explicit |
| `docs/BEHAVIORAL_RULE_COVERAGE.md` carried Prompt-06-only status wording | refreshed to Prompt-07 closure wording without promoting enforcement status |

## Behavioral Rule Coverage final status

Verified rule classes:

| rule | final ledger status | closure conclusion |
|---|---|---|
| `PG-BOUNDARY-001` | `validator_backed` | no specialist schema/logic ownership is claimed |
| `PG-SCHEMA-001` | `validator_backed` | exact Project Gate schema registry remains the carrier |
| `PG-EVIDENCE-001` | `validator_backed` | no accepted path is documented without explicit evidence |
| `PG-SYNTH-001` | `validator_backed` | synthetic evidence remains insufficient for real EV4 readiness |
| `PG-ADAPTER-001` | `validator_backed` | official adapters remain runner-bound; no fallback adapter is authorized |
| `PG-VALIDATOR-001` | `validator_backed` | official validators remain runner-bound and fail-closed |
| `PG-HASH-001` | `validator_backed` | deterministic canonical JSON/hash behavior remains documented and tested by existing test files/CI steps |
| `PG-LOCK-001` | `validator_backed` | lock reproduction/verification remains documented and wired through CI |
| `PG-STATUS-001` | `validator_backed` | status icon/text/tone and target status semantics are documented |
| `PG-OUTPUT-001` | `validator_backed` | output success/download requires final path existence after atomic write |
| `PG-UNICODE-001` | `validator_backed` | Persian RTL and technical LTR isolation remain documented |
| `PG-PROGRESS-001` | `validator_backed` | progress must not affect canonical final hashes |
| `PG-BRC-001` | `fixture_tested` | behavioral coverage honesty is fixture-tested |
| `PG-DOWNSTREAM-001` | `fixture_tested` | only false downstream-enforcement claims are fixture-tested; real downstream rejection evidence is not claimed |

No `downstream_contract_enforced` rule is claimed.

No Critical rule remains `prose_only` or shallow `schema_backed` in the closure ledger.

## Tests and CI evidence inspected

Confirmed from handoffs and GitHub workflow run lookup:

- Prompt-04 PR #20 final head `42bfa484481c585f589d86c40424660c70b038a0`: Skeleton Health run `28744810186` success.
- Prompt-05 PR #23 exact head `cf69f83682e65154678a85d05d9e2f3d31bdedaa`: Prompt-05 run `28749872553` success and Skeleton Health run `28749872558` success.
- Prompt-06 PR #24 final head `c8522cf36e65243dfebc3f9b2f0b3feb97cbedf4`: Prompt-06 run `28754737277`, Prompt-05 run `28754737310`, Skeleton Health run `28754737291`, and Historical Merge Ledger run `28754835391` all success.
- Prompt-07 PR #26 reviewed head `531960f76f1ca0f09b948b69578dbb968e464ff6`: Prompt 06 Report UX run `28755207049`, Prompt 05 Builder Responsive Final Gate run `28755207015`, and Skeleton Health run `28755207013` all success.

Not run in this closure environment:

- local full clone;
- local `python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'`;
- local full `pytest`;
- local `ev4-transition` CLI smoke tests.

Reason: the local container could not resolve `github.com`, so local clone/test execution was unavailable. GitHub connector write/read was available.

## Release readiness classification

```yaml
classification: implementation_ready_with_known_gaps
```

Rationale:

- deterministic core, lock/hash behavior, runner boundary, behavioral coverage validation, CE→Builder baseline, Builder→Responsive baseline, Final Evidence Gate baseline, Persian reporting layer, and closure-audit documentation are implemented;
- exact-head CI evidence exists for Prompt-07 PR #26 reviewed head `531960f76f1ca0f09b948b69578dbb968e464ff6` and earlier transition PRs;
- no known Critical false-accepted path is documented in the closure audit;
- no copied specialist schema is claimed;
- remaining gaps are explicitly `insufficient_evidence`.

Not classified as `personal_use_ready` because real non-synthetic EV4 handoff/evidence, frontend/export/accessibility correctness, and downstream owner rejection evidence are not available.

Not classified as `invalid_release_state` because this audit did not find a known contradiction, hash mismatch, schema mismatch, or false accepted path after stale prose cleanup.

## Remaining insufficient evidence

- exact current `main` ref SHA/CI after this Prompt-07 closure branch is merged, if merged;
- real non-synthetic CE→Builder transition evidence;
- real Builder execution evidence bundle;
- real Responsive input/output evidence bundle;
- accessibility/export/frontend correctness evidence;
- downstream owner rejection evidence before any `downstream_contract_enforced` claim.

## Safe next actions

1. Observe GitHub Actions on the next PR head if this documentation refresh creates a new commit.
2. Confirm no reviewer finds a false-readiness claim.
3. Merge PR #26 only after explicit owner approval.
4. Keep remaining real-evidence gaps as `insufficient_evidence` until real owner evidence bundles exist.
